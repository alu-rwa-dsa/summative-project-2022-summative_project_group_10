When the user wins, a song is suggested for you to listen to. You discover new kinds of music, that rather
keeping a boring playing list of repeated music.

problems and making decisions that involves themselves and other people, because in playing this game
you have to learn to predict the next person's move, in order to make yours. It is quite complex

will do the magic.

* How it works:
The user enters either an X or an O in the grind and wait for the computer to respond
If you choose an X, then  the computer will choose an O and vice versa.
If you are able to get three of your plays(X or O) in a straightline, you win, hence you get a song suggestion
However, if you lose to the computer, you are given a suggestion to play again, or quit(you don't get a song suggestion)
If you draw with the computer, you can replay or quit.

* Challenges of this Application:
it is quite hard to defeat the computer,because it can always predict your next move easily as compared, to plannijg it with someone who isn't that 
skilled in being strategic towards the game.
Also, most kids who come from low-income families, might not be able to access this, since their family might not
be able to afford a technological device on which this can be installed.
